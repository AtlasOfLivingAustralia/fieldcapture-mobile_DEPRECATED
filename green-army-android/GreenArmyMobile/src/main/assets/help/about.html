<h2>About</h2>

<p>
The Green Army programme is an Australian Government initiative providing young Australians with opportunities to develop skills, undertake training and gain experience in environmental and heritage conservation by participating in projects that generate real benefits for the environment.  For more information on the Green Army, go to: <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/cleaner-environment/clean-land/green-army">http://www.environment.gov.au/cleaner-environment/clean-land/green-army</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Green Army Programme app enables Green Army service providers to capture project activity data in the field, using an Android OS device. Data can be uploaded into the Department&#2019;s online reporting tool (MERIT) once the device is connected to the internet.
</p>
<p>
Prior to using the app, users must have an approved project plan in MERIT and a MERIT user log-in.  Visit <a href="https://fieldcapture.ala.org.au/">https://fieldcapture.ala.org.au/</a> for more details on MERIT.

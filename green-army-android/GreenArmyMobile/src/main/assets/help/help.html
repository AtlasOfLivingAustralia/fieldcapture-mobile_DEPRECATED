<h2>Help</h2>
<p>
A user guide for the Green Army programme app is available at <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/land/green-army">http://www.environment.gov.au/land/green-army</a>. It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the user guide before using this app.
</p>
<p class="important">
    Important: While the app is in use, it is strongly recommended that no changes are made to the project in the online reporting tool, MERIT (i.e. data added or activities changed in MERIT). During the sync process, data in MERIT will be overridden with data captured by the app.
</p>
<p class="warning">
DO NOT logout of the app if you have not synced your data with MERIT, otherwise data you have captured in the app will be lost.
</p>


<span class="question">How do I create a site?</span>

<p>
    <b>Step 1.</b> Tap the &#2018;new site&#2019; button at the top right of the main app screen. Alternatively, tap &#2018;create new site&#2019; from within an activity.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> The GPS on your tablet will automatically find your location. Allow a few moments for your GPS to find and refine the location of your site.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 3.</b> Enter the site name and a description, then tap &#2018;done&#2019; on the top right of the screen. Your site will be added to the list of sites for your project.
</p>


<span class="question">How do I sort activities?</span>
<p>
    Activities can be sorted by start date, type, site and progress. Swipe from the right or left hand side of the screen to sort your activity list.
</p>


<span class="question">How do I sync changes with MERIT?</span>
<p>
The Android version of the app will automatically attempt to synchronise (upload) your data with MERIT. If you don&#2019;t have Internet access, the app will wait until you do and then sync your data with MERIT.
</p>
<p>
If you have Internet connection, you can also sync your data with MERIT at a time of your choosing.
</p>

<b>Step 1.</b> Tap the menu button on the top right hand side of the screen and select &#2018;refresh data&#2019;.

<p class="warning">DO NOT logout of the app if you have not synced your data with MERIT, otherwise data you have captured in the app will be lost.</p>

<span class="question">How do I cancel or defer activities?</span>
You cannot defer or cancel activities using the app. This needs to be done from within MERIT by your Service Provider, in consultation with the Department of the Environment.

<span class="question">How do I delete a site?</span>
You cannot delete a site using the app. This needs to be done from within MERIT.

<span class="question">How do I add photos of a site or activity?</span>
Photos can only be added to a project via MERIT at this stage. While you are conducting your activities, you may wish to take photos and add them to MERIT later.

<span class="question">I forgot my password</span>
If you have forgotten your password you will need to reset it via the MERIT website. You cannot request a password reset through the Green Army Programme app.

<span class="question">Who do I contact for assistance?</span>
For technical support using the app, contact the MERIT team at <a href="mailto:merit@environment.gov.au">merit@environment.gov.au</a> or 1800 552 008. If you need to speak to someone about your project, contact your Service Provider.
